## RPG Toolbox Pendragon's Core library
Default implementation of the Pendragon's API extension for the library for the RPG Toolbox libraries.

### Version
The project is still under development, so expect a certain degree of instability. Class paths and names may change, and classes keep receiving enhancements which make them change with frequency.

## Building
The application was coded using Java, and dependencies are handled through Maven.

### JDK
Coded with JDK 7.

### Dependencies
All dependencies are handled through Maven, and noted on the pom file.

But currently my projects lack a Maven repository, and so can't be handled automatically by this application.

The list of projects which need to be manually downloaded and installed are:
* [Wandrell's Core library][]
* [Wandrell's Framework library][]
* [RPG Toolbox API library][]

### Getting the code
The GitHub project is found at https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/RPG-Toolbox-Pendragon-Swing, and it includes the git clone uri.
